[!include[](shared/unity-sync.md)]  

<br/>
**How To**  

* Make sure that you are logged in in Trivver settings and selected proper game and it's version.
* Choose ‘Trivver’ -> ‘Sync data with server’   
* Choose scenes that have [AdSpots](../terms/adspot.md), check option ‘Sync Images’ and press ‘Sync’. Note that the scene that you've just added spot to, has to be saved. 
* On successful synchronization, you will see message that confirms that synchronization is done.
