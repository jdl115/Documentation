# AdSpot Volume

AdSpot volume defines volume in space that can be covered by downloaded [branded object](xref:branded-asset-term).  
You can see it as a blue cube if display gizmo checked in AdSpot properties. It can be adjusted directly in scene view by dragging green dots, or by setting size in the inspector.
