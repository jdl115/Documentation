## Loading of Branded Assets

By default when you run the game InitSmartTab blueprint Actor is created in the scene. It creates SmartTab and requests common assets. You can override this behavior if you like.

For example take a look at the blueprint located at path:  
`Trivver Content\SmartTab\Blueprints\InitSnatTab`
