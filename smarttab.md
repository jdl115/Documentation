# SmartTab

SmartTab is a special UI panel, that displays assets and it's advertising data to the user and allows users to interact with this assets.  
In different SDK's SmartTab acts a little bit different, for example in Unity SDK it displays all the assets that were loaded during game-play, while in native SDK's it shows new list of assets each 3 minutes. Each asset in SmartTab has three display modes:

* 2d mode - displays main image of the asset and contains description information about it.
* 3d mode \(temporary not available in Native sdk's\) - displays asset as 3d model. This view allows to see the model from any angle.
* video mode - this mode shows the promo video associated with the asset.

In the upper section of SmartTab there is a list of branded assets that can be selected by the user.  
In the middle - there is viewport that displays selected asset in one of three modes.  
And on the bottom - there are two actions buttons.  
User can get special reward for selected asset called Coupon. After the user gets this coupon he can use it at later time to get some benefit while buying the product.  
The second button will lead the user to product web page.
